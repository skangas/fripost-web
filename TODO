* Content 
** Add explanation of the systems we are building
** Add "participate" page where suggestions are given on member activities
** Translate entire web site to Swedish
** English/Swedish "icons" for changing languages
** Graphical material?
** Work out better structure of website


* Technical/infrastructure
** Find out how we are to manage the website long-term

   Emacs MUSE or org-mode seem like two viable alternatives.

** How are we to handle translations?

   Perhaps look at how gnu.org manages this, though we will only ever need two
   languages (English/Swedish).  Most will probably be only in Swedish, but a
   few key pages should be available in English.

** Add a wiki
*** Decide on what software to use
*** Move all content from fellowship.se to this new wiki
