#+TITLE:     Join Fripost
#+SETUPFILE: includes/level-0.org

In order to have the actual service up and running, we are dependent on
getting a sufficient amount of members joining. The starting budget needed is
about 15000 SEK. With a member fee of 300 SEK we will need 50 members before we
can really get going.  

To become a member, you must live in Sweden.  Please note that there is
absolutely no requirement that you are a Swedish citizen, the only requirement
is that you live here.

To join, send an email to our president Stefan Kangas at [[mailto:skangas@skangas.se][skangas@skangas.se]], and
make a payment according to below.

* Member information

Fripost cares about its members integrity, and encourages vigilance against
giving out personal information. In that spirit Fripost offers anonymous
memberships, for which the only information needed is

- The desired email address (e.g. your.name@fripost.org).

However, in order to make it possible for Fripost to reach to you with important
information, you may want to provide

- Full name
- Current email address (recommended)
- Phone number 
- Physical address 
- Whether you want to join the member mailing list

The member mailing list is the main channel for information within the
association. Members are not added by default, so you have to explicitly state
that you what to be added to the list.

** Payment

The easiest way to pay the membership fee of 300 SEK is through

|----------+----------|
| Plusgiro | 477884-1 |
| Bankgiro | 311-5060 |
|----------+----------|

Give your name or user name in the message field. It is also possible to use
cash payment, but in that case contact Stefan Kangas.


** The deal

A membership means:

- One email address, one inbox, and the possibility of one extra alias at fripost.org
- The possibility to associate one domain of your own to fripost.org
- Unlimited number of aliases on the associated domain.
